# Firebase-Python
Since the SDK and Support for Python is not that great in python.
I think that it would be useful to use NodeJS and Create a API
in which any one can send a request and the funtion will be done
correct so they will need to pass the firebase config then they can use python to send
the requests or any other programming langauge easily. I am going to contribute the most I can to this project.
But if you want to contribute fork this repo and create new features and create a new pull requests.
